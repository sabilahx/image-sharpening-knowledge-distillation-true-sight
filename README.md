# image-sharpening-knowledge-distillation-true-sight
A lightweight CNN-based image sharpening model trained via self-supervised knowledge distillation, where ground truth sharp images act as a fake teacher. The student model is optimized using a combination of perceptual, MSE, and edge-aware losses for enhanced sharpness and perceptual quality.
