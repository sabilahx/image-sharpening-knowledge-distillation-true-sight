# image-sharpening-knowledge-distillation-true-sight
A lightweight CNN-based image sharpening model trained via self-supervised knowledge distillation, where ground truth sharp images act as a fake teacher. The student model is optimized using a combination of perceptual, MSE, and edge-aware losses for enhanced sharpness and perceptual quality.

#  Image Sharpening using Teacher-Student CNN Architecture

This project implements an image sharpening model using a *Teacher-Student CNN architecture, where the **student network is trained using ground truth sharp images* (i.e., no pretrained teacher network is used). The method combines *MSE, **MS-SSIM, and **edge-aware losses* to produce sharper and perceptually accurate results.

## Dataset

*Dataset Used:* [GoPro Dataset](https://seungjunnah.github.io/Datasets/gopro)

### Folder Structure:

E:/image/data/GOPRxxxx_xx_xx/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ blur/         # Original blurry frames â”œâ”€â”€ sharp/        # Ground truth sharp images â””â”€â”€ blur_gamma/   # Input to model (sharpening target)

---

##  Model Architecture

*Model:* StudentCNN_v3  
A deep convolutional neural network with residual connections and dilation.

### Features:
- 6 convolutional layers
- Skip connections for stable training
- Dilation to enlarge receptive field
- Output normalized to [0, 1] using Sigmoid

##  Loss Function

### Combined Loss:

Loss = Î± * MSE + (1 - Î±) * (1 - MS-SSIM) + edge_weight * Edge_Loss

- *MSE* â€“ pixel-wise fidelity
- *MS-SSIM* â€“ perceptual similarity
- *Edge Loss* â€“ Sobel edge L1 difference
- Î± = 0.8, edge_weight = 1.0
